    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>XSpeak is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant. We are committed to protecting your privacy by ensuring that all your data stays on your device. This Privacy Policy explains how XSpeak handles your information.</p>

    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>XSpeak does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data</strong>.</li>
        <li>The app does <strong>not access</strong> your contacts, identity, email, or any external accounts.</li>
        <li>XSpeak does <strong>not use</strong> third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li>During meetings, audio is temporarily recorded and held <strong>only in memory</strong>, limited to the last 300 seconds.</li>
        <li>This temporary audio data is <strong>never saved, stored permanently, or transmitted anywhere</strong>.</li>
        <li>If you choose to create a voice profile, XSpeak may store a local <strong>voice embedding</strong> (a numeric representation of your voice) <strong>only on your device</strong>.</li>
        <li>All processing and storage happen <strong>entirely on your device</strong>; no data is ever uploaded or shared externally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. On-Device Processing</h2>
    <p>All core features of XSpeak run entirely on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transcription of meetings is performed in real-time using on-device audio processing.</li>
        <li>AI analysis (summarization and insights) is powered by an on-device language model.</li>
        <li>If you create a voice profile, it is stored locally in the form of anonymized embeddings and remains on the device as long as the app is installed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Temporary Recording Storage</h2>
    <p>XSpeak temporarily stores a short segment of the meeting audio on your device to enable real-time transcription and analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only the <strong>last 300 seconds (5 minutes)</strong> of audio are kept in memory at any time.</li>
        <li>Audio is stored <strong>locally</strong> and is <strong>not saved permanently</strong>.</li>
        <li>All audio is automatically deleted when:
            <ul>
                <li>the app is closed,</li>
                <li>the Reset button is tapped,</li>
                <li>or new audio overwrites the previous buffer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Recordings are never uploaded, transmitted, or stored externally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User-Initiated AI</h2>
    <p>AI analysis is performed <strong>only when manually triggered</strong> by the user. XSpeak does not perform any automatic or background analysis.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users within the app. Continued use of the app after any changes means you agree to the updated terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how XSpeak handles your data, you can contact us through the support link provided in the App Store listing.</p>
